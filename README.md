# Travis CI Side Scrolling Game made by Montana Mendy 

This was made on the weekend of August 21-22, 2021 by Montana Mendy. I've made it simple to start, and start playing. It features Mr. T dodging broken builds, win32, spaghetti code and much more.

## Usage

Just clone the git repo, and click on `index.html` and this will start the game locally. I made this in a way (CSS) so it would be easy to use deliaberetly instead of using something like JavaScript (which that version is in the works).

## TODO: 

* Character selection 
* Difficulty settings 
* Verbose outputs 
* Levels 
* Ending


### Credits

* Montana Mendy (Code/Logic)
* Michelle Pruitt (Creatives)
